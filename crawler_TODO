TODO 
for the new, modular crawler engine of Noodle NG:

- Standardized Logging (Really much output in debug,
  only host-based information in info and failures etc in
  warnings and up)
- Better Error/Exception handling from database and filesystem
  (without loosing traceback information, just in case)
- User-Defined Handler-Functions for special tasks
  (e.g. Special file .noodle in root-directory in which hosts
  can specify files/directories to exclude etc)
- More controllable debug-modes (disable/enable multiprocessing,
  level of output, etc)
- Think about all the Unicode-Stuff again... 
- Port changes in CrawlerSMB to CrawlerFTP
- Local file crawler (shouldn't be much work) -> CrawlerLOCAL

- Reconcile classes... Propably it would be senseful to have
  a SMBHost-Object like ftputil provides and use that for all
  filesystem operations (proxyDownloader in Mind)
