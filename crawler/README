filesystem_test.py
==================
Contains test cases for filesystem implementations to verify if their output 
is the same as from os functions,
Implementations must be added to this file and must be configured correctly
(e.g. mount a smb share and specify local mount point for verification)

filesystem.py 
==================
contains an "interface" that filesystem implementations shall provide 
to be useful for noodle

fs_os.py
==================
"implements" filesystem.py for filesystem operations on the 
host operating system (which of course is not very useful, but ideal for testing)

fs_smb.py
==================
provides access to a filesystem via smb
paths should be provided as smb://[username[:password]@]host/share[/path]
