filesystem.py 
==================
contains an "interface" that filesystem implementations shall provide to be useful for noodle

fs_os.py
==================
"implements" filesystem.py for filesystem operations on the host operating system (which of course is not very useful, but ideal for testing)

test.py
==================
tests the native implementation and the artificial implementation of os filesystem operations
To verify that all implementations are identical, compare the parts between the ###..# separators.
$ diff test-native.txt test-artificial.txt

fs_smb.py
==================
first attempt to implement filesystem operations via pysmbc
At the moment, the algorithm doesn't go deeper than one level.
It should recall itself with a deeper directory path, but propably because
of the yield function this doesn't work.
